# DCIT 318 Assignment 2 - Object-Oriented Programming in C#

## Overview

This repository contains three C# console applications demonstrating key object-oriented programming concepts:

1. **Inheritance and Method Overriding**  
   - Base class `Animal` with method `MakeSound()`.  
   - Derived classes `Dog` and `Cat` overriding `MakeSound()`.

2. **Abstract Classes and Methods**  
   - Abstract class `Shape` with abstract method `GetArea()`.  
   - Derived classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` implementing `GetArea()`.

3. **Interfaces**  
   - Interface `IMovable` with method `Move()`.  
   - Classes `Car` and `Bicycle` implementing `IMovable`.

## How to Run

- Open the solution or individual `.cs` files in your C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code).  
- Build and run each program separately to see the output for each task.

## Commit History

Each task was implemented and committed separately to show progress clearly.
